# Credit Card Fraud Machine Learning Algorithm 

Created a bilayer neural network to recieve data and output a boolean value. The boolean value corresponds to whether an instance of credit card activity was fraudulent. Used ReLU and sigmoid activation functions, Glorot-Xavier for initialization. Trained on 50,000 instances and tested on 10,000. Project had an accuracy of 98% on all entries. 

Further extensions of this project: Considerably more instances of non-fraud activity so model better trained to predict 0 over 1 - potential changes would be weighting instances of fraud claims higher.
